# DaggerCoffee<br />
Since I heard the concept of dependency injection for the first time, I always wanted to create a simple project in Eclipse to test whether I understand the concepts correctly.<br />
<br />
It turned out so hard... 2 years after using Dagger in Android apps, I returned to this topic and created this repo.<br />
<br />
So there are 6 jars to be added to Build Path and Factory Path:<br />
dagger-2.9.jar<br />
dagger-compiler-2.9.jar<br />
dagger-producers-2.9.jar<br />
guava-20.0-rc1.jar<br />
javax.inject-1.jar<br />
javax.annotation-api-1.2.jar<br />
<br />
